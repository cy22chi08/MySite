Don't you know I'm no good for you?<br>
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to<br>
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'<br>
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own<br>
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that<br>
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Don't you know too much already?<br>
I'll only hurt you if you let me<br>
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)<br>
And I'll call you when the party's over<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own<br>
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that<br>
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
But nothin' is better sometimes<br>
Once we've both said our goodbyes<br>
Let's just let it go<br>
Let me let you go<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own<br>
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that<br>
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that<br>

<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Verse 1]<br>
I had a dream<br>
I got everything I wanted<br>
Not what you'd think<br>
And if I'm bein' honest<br>
It might've been a nightmare<br>
To anyone who might care<br>
Thought I could fly (Fly)<br>
So I stepped off the Golden, mm<br>
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)<br>
Nobody even noticed<br>
I saw them standing right there<br>
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
I had a dream<br>
I got everything I wanted<br>
But when I wake up, I see<br>
You with me<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you<br>
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to<br>
If I could change the way that you see yourself<br>
You wouldn't wonder why you hear<br>
'They don't deserve you'"<br>
<br>
You might also like<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I tried to scream<br>
But my head was underwater<br>
They called me weak<br>
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter<br>
Coulda been a nightmare<br>
But it felt like they were right there<br>
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago<br>
But I don't wanna let anybody know<br>
'Cause everybody wants something from me now<br>
And I don't wanna let 'em down<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
I had a dream<br>
I got everything I wanted<br>
But when I wake up, I see<br>
You with me<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you<br>
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to<br>
If I could change the way that you see yourself<br>
You wouldn't wonder why you hear<br>
'They don't deserve you'"<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?<br>
Would I do it again?<br>
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head<br>
What would they say instead?<br>
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?<br>
Would I do it again?<br>
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head<br>
What would they say instead?<br>

<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Chorus]<br>
When I'm away from you<br>
I'm happier than ever<br>
Wish I could explain it better<br>
I wish it wasn't true<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Give me a day or two to think of something clever<br>
To write myself a letter<br>
To tell me what to do, mm-mm<br>
Do you read my interviews?<br>
Or do you skip my avenue?<br>
When you said you were passin' through<br>
Was I even on your way?<br>
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)<br>
Be cool about what I was tellin' you<br>
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)<br>
And I'd end up more afraid<br>
Don't say it isn't fair<br>
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable<br>
So if you really wanna know<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)<br>
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)<br>
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)<br>
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
You call me again, drunk in your Benz<br>
Drivin' home under the influence<br>
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath<br>
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends<br>
I don't relate to you<br>
I don't relate to you, no<br>
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty<br>
You made me hate this city<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet<br>
Never told anyone anything bad<br>
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything<br>
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad<br>
So don't waste the time I don't have<br>
And don't try to make me feel bad<br>
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time<br>
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did<br>
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I<br>
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
You ruined everything good<br>
Always said you were misunderstood<br>
Made all my moments your own<br>
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)<br>
(Ah)<br>
(Goddamn)<br>
(Ah)<br>
(Fuck you)<br>
(Fuck you)<br>

<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Verse 1]<br>
I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well<br>
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself<br>
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for<br>
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door<br>
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more<br>
Than anyone before (Anyone before)<br>
Too bad they're usually deranged<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Last week, I realized I crave pity<br>
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse<br>
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing<br>
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed<br>
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest<br>
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)<br>
Now we're estranged<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Things I once enjoyed<br>
Just keep me employed now<br>
Things I'm longing for<br>
Someday, I'll be bored of<br>
It's so weird<br>
That we care so much until we don't<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders<br>
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong<br>
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor<br>
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure<br>
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise<br>
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)<br>
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Things I once enjoyed<br>
Just keep me employed now, mmm<br>
Things I'm longing for, mmm<br>
Someday, I'll be bored of<br>
It's so weird<br>
That we care so much until we don't<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing<br>
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine<br>
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna<br>
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time<br>

Hmm, hmm<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I fell in love for the first time<br>
With a friend, it's a good sign<br>
Feelin' off when I feel fine<br>
Twenty-one took a lifetime<br>
People say I look happy<br>
Just because I got skinny<br>
But the old me is still me and maybe the real me<br>
And I think she's pretty<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And I still cry<br>
Cry<br>
And you know why<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Am I acting my age now?<br>
Am I already on the way out?<br>
When I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage<br>
I'm a dog in a dog pound<br>
And you said I was your secret<br>
And you didn't get to keep it<br>
And the internet is hungry for the meanest kind of funny<br>
And somebody's gotta feed it<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Oh, do you still cry?<br>
Still cry<br>
Cry<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I nеver did you wrong (Never did you wrong)<br>
And my (Oh), my patiеnce is gone (Is gone)<br>
And I (I), I never did you wrong (You)<br>
I, I loved you for so long (Hmm)<br>
