<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Verse 1]<br>
Don't you notice how<br>
I get quiet when there's no one else around?<br>
Me and you and awkward silence<br>
Don't you dare look at me that way<br>
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Oh, the burning pain<br>
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate<br>
"She's so perfect," blah, blah, blah<br>
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day<br>
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
That when I talk to you<br>
Oh, Cupid walks right through<br>
And shoots an arrow through my heart<br>
And I sound like a loon<br>
But don't you feel it, too?<br>
Confess I loved you from the start<br>
<br>
[Scat Break]<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
What's a girl to do?<br>
Lying on my bed staring into the bluе<br>
Unrequited, terrifying<br>
Lovе is driving me a bit insane<br>
Have to get this off my chest, I'm telling you today<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
That when I talk to you<br>
Oh, Cupid walks right through<br>
And shoots an arrow through my heart<br>
And I sound like a loon<br>
But don't you feel it, too?<br>
Confess I loved you from the start<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Confess I loved you<br>
Just thinking of you<br>
I know I've loved you from the start<br>

<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Verse 1]<br>
Feeling kind of sick tonight<br>
All I've had is coffee and leftover pie<br>
It's no wonder why<br>
Still you take up all my mind<br>
I don't even think that you care like I do<br>
I should stop<br>
Heaven knows I've tried<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
One day<br>
I will stop falling in love with you<br>
Some day<br>
Someone will like me like I like you<br>
Until then I'll drink my coffee<br>
Eat my pie<br>
Pretend that we are more than friends<br>
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I'm just tryna understand<br>
What I am to you<br>
More than songs we've exchanged<br>
Midnight calls<br>
Sunset views<br>
Promise I don't mean to cry<br>
But I get overwhelmed and confused<br>
If only you knew<br>
What I felt like<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
One day<br>
I will stop falling in love with you<br>
Some day<br>
Someone will like me like I like you<br>
Until then I'll drink my coffee<br>
Eat my pie<br>
Pretend that we are more than friends<br>
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Some day<br>
One day<br>
I will stop falling in love with you<br>
Until I do<br>
I'll be thinking of you<br>
Let you break my heart again<br>

<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Verse 1]<br>
I made a promise<br>
To distance myself<br>
Took a flight through aurora skies<br>
Honestly I didn't think about<br>
How we didn't say, "Goodbye"<br>
Just, "See you very soon"<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
It hurts to be something<br>
It's worse to be nothing with you<br>
Mm, mm-mm, mm<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
So, I didn't call you<br>
For sixteen long days<br>
And I should get a cigarette<br>
For so much restraint<br>
No matter how long I resist temptation<br>
I will always lose<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
It hurts to be something<br>
It's worse to be nothing with you<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I've done the math<br>
There's no solution<br>
We'll never last<br>
Why can't I let go of this?<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
So, I broke my promise<br>
I called you last night<br>
I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have<br>
If it weren't for the sight of a boy<br>
Who lookеd just like you<br>
Standing out on Melrose Avеnue<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
It hurts to be something<br>
It's worse to be nothing with you<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
It hurts to be something<br>
It's worse to be nothing with you<br>

<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Verse 1]<br>
The whole town is talking 'bout how you've fallen in love<br>
I read in the papers he's someone that girls dream about<br>
Some kind of ruler on top of a kingdom<br>
I'm just a jester, I'll never be him<br>
Last night you called to me<br>
It almost killed me<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
To hear you scream my name<br>
Your smile still kills the same<br>
I almost turned around<br>
You chased me to the ground<br>
You asked me how I've been<br>
But how do I begin<br>
To tell you I should've chased<br>
You 'cross every single state?<br>
I lay down my sword for fate<br>
'Cause it's too little, way too late<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I didn't need the reminder of things I've done wrong<br>
Of promises broken, fragility hidden in song<br>
Guess that we're soulmates in different lifetimes<br>
What if you leave him? Throw me a lifeline<br>
I know that you're happy<br>
But it just killed me<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
To hear you scream my name<br>
A clear fucking X-ray<br>
Of if I'd stuck around<br>
I swear to God, I almost drowned<br>
You asked me how I've been<br>
But how could I begin<br>
To tell you I should've chased you<br>
I should be who you're engaged to?<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Lost my fight with fate<br>
A tug-of-war of leave and stay<br>
I give in, I abdicate<br>
I lay my sword down anyway<br>
I'll see you at Heaven's gate<br>
'Cause it's too little, way too late<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
I'll toast outside your wedding day<br>
Whisper vows I'll never say to you<br>
'Cause it's too little, all too late<br>

<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Verse 1]<br>
I've rejected affection<br>
For years and years<br>
Now I have it and damn it<br>
It‘s kind of weird<br>
<br>
He tells me I'm pretty<br>
Don't know how to respond<br>
I tell him that he's pretty too<br>
Can I say that? Don‘t have a clue<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
With every passing moment<br>
I surprise myself<br>
I‘m scared of flies<br>
I‘m scared of guys<br>
Someone please help<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
'Cause I think I've fallen<br>
In love this time<br>
I blinked and suddenly I had a Valentine<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
What if he's the last one I kiss?<br>
What if he's the only one I'll ever miss?<br>
Maybe I should run, I'm only twenty-one<br>
I don‘t even know who I want to become<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I've lost all control of my heartbeat now<br>
Got caught in a romance with him somehow<br>
I still feel a shock through every bone<br>
When I hear an “I love you”<br>
'Cause now I've got someone to lose<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
The first one to ever like me back<br>
I‘m seconds away from a heart attack<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
How the hell did I fall in love this time?<br>
And honestly, I can‘t believe I get to call you mine<br>
I blinked and suddenly<br>
I had a Valentine<br>
