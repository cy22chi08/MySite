<div class="lyrics"><h3>Lyrics:</h3><p>[Verse 1]<br>
I don't go out, but I’ll do it for you<br>
You never liked it when I drink too much<br>
I hate to dance, but I'll dance with you<br>
'Cause I’d do anything to feel your touch<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Don't like anybody, tell me why it's different with you<br>
Don't believe in love, but no one makes me feel like you do<br>
I don't say it much, 'cause I just always thought that you knew, ahh<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
It's what you do to me<br>
I'm wrapped around your finger and I can’t stop<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
Baby, can’t you see?<br>
I need you, 'cause you’re everything that I'm not<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Too late<br>
Don't wanna fall, baby, I just<br>
Don't need somebody else to throw me aside<br>
But I’m up all night<br>
Thinkin' 'bout how it can be you to change my heart, but I<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Don't like anybody, tell me why it's different with you<br>
Don't believe in love, but no one makes me feel like you do<br>
I don't say it much, 'cause I just always thought that you knew, ahh<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
It's what you do to me<br>
I'm wrapped around your finger and I can't stop<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
Baby, can't you see?<br>
I need you, 'cause you're everything that I'm not<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
It's what you do to me<br>
I'm wrapped around your finger and I can't stop<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
You know I got a soft spot for you<br>

I take it you’re leaving<br>
This never gets easier for me<br>
I’ll miss how you promised me the world, and I believed it<br>
You give me your reasons<br>
And they cut me deeper than it seems<br>
No need to worry 'bout it<br>
I can stop the bleeding<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Oh, babe, you know<br>
It happens all the time<br>
You give your heart to someone<br>
But they go and change their mind<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Everybody wants somebody<br>
Needs nobody, anybody<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Used to things fallin' apart<br>
Knew how it would end from the start<br>
But I can’t help but chase the feeling<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Ohh-oh, but, babе, you know<br>
It happens all the time<br>
You givе your heart to someone<br>
But they go and change their mind<br>
You don’t have to stay you know<br>
If it’s all a waste of time<br>
'Cause I’m used to having no one<br>
To lay here by my side<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Everybody wants somebody, needs nobody, anybody<br>
Everybody wants somebody, needs nobody, anybody<br>
Ooh, you leave me torn in two, ooh<br>
Ooh, like they always do, ooh<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Everybody wants somebody (Somebody)<br>
Needs nobody, anybody (Somebody)<br>
Everybody wants somebody (Somebody)<br>
Needs nobody, anybody (Somebody)<br>

<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I just been goin' through motions, back and forth like a ocean<br>
I am a fraud, I am the shit, hoping that nobody notice<br>
Bang chest in the morning, head down in the night<br>
Drink less if I wanted, strike up with the light<br>
And square up, I’m the mightest<br>
Myself in the fight, hurt twice but I tried it<br>
No advice for this shit, might die for this shit<br>
Do I feel alive, feel alive, feel alive?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Feel more like limbo, hands out my window<br>
Chasin' that sunset, that's more my tempo<br>
Yeah, that’s more my tempo<br>
Ooh, but this is all that I am<br>
I only show you the best of me<br>
The best of me<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Looked in my demons and saw myself<br>
Put all my meanin' in someone else<br>
Outta sight, outta mind, don't know where to find it<br>
Don't know where to hide, but I still<br>
Eat good, drink good, feel good, s'all good<br>
Can't hear my head when I'm sat beside ya<br>
Fucked lungs and a liver, good looks in the mirror<br>
Do I feel alive, feel alive, feel alive?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Feel more like limbo, hands out my window<br>
Chasin' that sunset, that’s more my tempo<br>
That’s more my tempo<br>
(keshi) Ooh, but this is all that I am<br>
I only show you the best of me<br>
The best of me<br>
Ooh, tryin' but I’m just a man<br>
Hopin' it won't get the best of me<br>
The best of me<br>

Wrong but it feels so right<br>
Wrong but it feels so right<br>
It don’t make sense but it feels so nice<br>
Show me, show me, oh<br>
Show me your chest on mine<br>
Show me your legs up high<br>
I don’t wanna kiss all night, kiss all night<br>
(Ohh)<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Wrong but it feels so right<br>
Wrong but it feels so right<br>
It don’t make sense, but it feels so nice<br>
Show me, show me, oh<br>
Show me your chest on mine<br>
Show me your legs up high<br>
I don’t wanna kiss all night, kiss all night<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
If you want me, say you want me<br>
Treadin' softly, on my body while you tell me<br>
That you’re takin' it slow, but you’re pullin' me close<br>
If I bow to the throne, is it better than us?<br>
Give me comfort, give me warnin'<br>
When I wake, you’rе always missin' in the mornin'<br>
But you don’t need to run, if you’re looking for love<br>
Said it’s only a touch, is it bеtter than us to you?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Wrong but it feels so right<br>
Wrong but it feels so right<br>
It don’t make sense, but it feels so nice<br>
Show me, show me, oh<br>
Show me your chest on mine<br>
Show me your legs up high<br>
I don’t wanna kiss all night, kiss all night<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm<br>
Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm<br>
Can’t talk with your tongue in my mouth<br>
I was thinkin' 'bout us when you’re runnin' about<br>
Saw another one’s car at the front of the house<br>
Knew I never meant much, but it’s killin' me now<br>
Mmm, mmm<br>
Tell me all the things I wanna hear, so come here<br>
Beautiful, anyone will do<br>
But you don’t need to run, if you’re looking for love<br>
If it’s only a touch, was it better than us to you?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Wrong but it feels so right<br>
Wrong but it feels so right<br>
It don’t make sense, but it feels so nice<br>
Show me, show me, oh<br>
Show me your chest on mine<br>
Show me your legs up high<br>
I don’t wanna kiss all night, kiss all night<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Wrong but it feels— wrong— wrong— it—<br>
Wrong but it feels so right— right<br>
It don't make sense, but it feels so nice— nice<br>
Show me, show m—, —ice<br>

Never thought that I'd find<br>
That the one in my life would be so near<br>
And now you're here<br>
I got you, you got me<br>
When it's us, babe, you make me feel complete<br>
You're all I need<br>

Maybe we can try it if you let me<br>
Take you by the hand<br>
You're the only one who understands<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
So I guess that it's time<br>
I asked you to be mine for all my days<br>
I hope you'll stay<br>
I'll admit that I'm scared<br>
'Cause I've never really cared as much as this<br>
It's worth the risk<br>
